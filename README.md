## Project Overview

Welcome to the LoRa 4G Cattle Management Collar and Gateway project! This innovative solution combines LoRa and 4G technologies to enable efficient cattle tracking, health monitoring, and milk yield management. Below are the key features and functionalities of the project:

### Gateway Features:

1. **Configurability:**
   - Easily configurable 4G LoRa gateway with options to connect to Wi-Fi.
   - Supports both plug power and battery operation for flexibility in deployment.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Equipped with a small display for user configuration of LoRa base modes.
   - Intuitive interface for modifying gateway settings through a dedicated app.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Receives data from LoRa nodes, processes it locally, and sends it to the cloud.
   - Enables customization of gateway behavior through the app.

### LoRa Nodes Features:

1. **Sensors:**
   - GPS for real-time location tracking.
   - Motion sensors for activity level monitoring.
   - Temperature sensor for health and comfort assessment.

2. **Data Transmission:**
   - Sends continuous data streams to the gateway for further processing.
   - LoRa technology ensures efficient and long-range communication.

3. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Cloud-based processing for data interpretation and prediction.
   - Predicts cattle health issues, tracks heat cycles, and provides vaccination alerts.

### RFID Integration:

1. **Milk Yield Management:**
   - RFID tags on cattle enable seamless identification.
   - Milk yield data stored in the server based on RFID tag information.

2. **Farm Analytics:**
   - Provides insights into individual cattle's milk yield.
   - Offers a comprehensive view of the overall health of the cattle on the farm.

## Applications:

1. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Predictive analytics for early detection of sick cattle.
   - Geofencing for managing cattle movement and preventing straying.

2. **Milk Station Integration:**
   - Efficient tracking of individual cattle's milk yield.
   - Data-driven insights into the overall health of the herd.

3. **Smart Farming:**
   - Real-time data for informed decision-making.
   - Enhances operational efficiency and animal welfare.

## Getting Started:

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Detailed instructions for setting up the LoRa 4G gateway and nodes.
   - Guidance on configuring the system for plug power or battery operation.

2. **Software Configuration:**
   - Instructions for using the app to configure gateway settings.
   - Guidance on modifying default LoRa modes for customized behavior.

3. **Data Processing:**
